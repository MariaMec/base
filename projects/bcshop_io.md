## Business Model
BCShop.io allows vendors to publish information about digital products and services, and customers – to purchase these products and services for Ethereum cryptocurrency. At that, all the data concerning products is stored as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Use of smart contracts allows for automatization of payment processing and account of products. In the simplest cases, creating a digital product offer is done with only a few clicks and does not require vendors to install any software. Purchasing digital products is a simple process too. Buyers make all payments in the Ethereum blockchain`s native currency – ETH. Creating sale offers, as well as buying products is done with the use of software, based on MyEtherWallet – one of the most popular Ethereum online wallets. That allows the service to be used on both desktops and mobile devices.
